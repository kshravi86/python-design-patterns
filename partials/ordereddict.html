"""
If you create a regular dict, you will note that it is an unordered data collection. Every time you print it out, the
order may be differen.

An OrderedDict keeps track of the order of the keys as they are added.

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    ordered_dict[fruit] = index
print(ordered_dict) # Will print it in the order there were inserted

"""
Something else to note about OrderDicts is that when you go to compare two OrderedDicts, they will not only test the
items for equality, but also that the order is correct. A regular dictionary only looks at the contents of the
dictionary and doesnâ€™t care about its order.

OrderDicts have two new methods in Python 3: popitem and move_to_end. The popitem method will return and remove a
(key, item) pair
