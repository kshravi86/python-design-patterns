"""
LRU cache will “wrap a function with a memoizing callable that saves up to the maxsize most recent calls.
In other words, it’s a decorator that adds caching to the function it decorates

There is also a typed parameter that we can pass to the decorator. It is a Boolean that tells the decorator to cache
arguments of different types separately if typed is set to True.
