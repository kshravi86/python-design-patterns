What is a tuple?
-----------------
A tuple is a lightweight object type which allows to store a sequence of immutable Python objects. They are just like
lists but have a few key differences. The major one is that unlike lists, you can not change a value in a tuple.
In order to access the value in a tuple you use integer indexes

Problem with tuples?
--------------------
Remembering which index should be used for each value
can lead to errors, especially if the tuple has a lot of fields and is constructed far from where it is used.

Named Tuple:
-------------
A namedtuple assigns names, as well as the numerical index, to each member.

Why use named tuples over dictionaries?
---------------------------------------
Namedtuple instances are just as memory efficient as regular tuples because they do not have per-instance dictionaries.
Thus, they are lightweight and require no more memory than regular tuples. This makes them faster than dictionaries.

Each kind of namedtuple is represented by its own class, created by using the namedtuple() factory function.
The arguments are the name of the new class and a string containing the names of the elements.
"""

from collections import namedtuple

# A named tuple has two required arguments. They are the tuple name and the tuple field_names.
# Our tuple name was ‘Person’ and the tuple field_names were ‘name’, ‘age’ and ‘gender’.
Person = namedtuple('Person', 'name age gender')
print('Type of Person:', type(Person))

bob = Person(name='Bob', age=30, gender='male')
print(f'Representation: {bob}')

# It is possible to access the fields of the namedtuple by name using dotted notation (obj.attr) as well as using the
# positional indexes of standard tuples.
jane = Person(name='Jane', age=29, gender='female')
print(f'Field by name: {jane.name}')

print('Fields by index:')
for p in [ bob, jane ]:
    print('%s is a %d year old %s' % p)

# We can covert a named tuple to a dictionary using the _asdict() method
print(bob._asdict())
